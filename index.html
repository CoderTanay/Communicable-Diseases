<h2>Definition:</h2> 

<p>A Strep Throat is a sore throat with fever caused by a group of bacteria which are called Streptococcus.</p>

<h2>Causes:</h2>

<p>You get strep throat from droplets. You can get this when you are near someone who is affected; and they talk, sneeze, or cough near you. This happens since when you do any of those three things you release droplets from your mouth or nose.</p>
